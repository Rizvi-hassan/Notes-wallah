                <p>
                    1. One of Goa's most famous beaches, <u>Colva attracts</u> crowds of tourists during high season
                    (mid-November through mid-February) — for good reason. The 2.4-kilometer-long beach in south Goa
                    offers an endless array of aquatic adventure sports (including jet skiing, banana boat rides, and
                    parasailing), sand that's as soft and as white as baby powder, and a well-developed tourism
                    infrastructure that can cater to your every need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. <u>Dona Paula</u> Beach is one of the best beaches in Goa for honeymoon tourists. Nicknamed
                    "Lovers'
                    Paradise," this coastal destination in the suburbs of Panaji even has its own love legend.
                    The tale is about Dona Paula, the daughter of a Portuguese viceroy, who threw herself into the
                    Arabian Sea after her father forbade her from seeing a Goan fisherman who had stolen her heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. <u>Morjim beach</u> in north Goa offers a more wild, rustic feel than others in the state. It's a
                    tranquil escape, lined with beach huts and sun beds, where you can spend hours on end. Morjim Beach
                    has earned the nickname "Little Russia" for the large influx of Russians who stay here for weeks at
                    a time. Its abundance of Russian restaurants can be a welcome change of pace from the rest of the
                    food in Goa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Accommodations in Goa don't get much quirkier than what you'll find at <u>Palolem Beach</u>.
                    Every year, locals in the hospitality industry erect temporary coco huts in which travelers can
                    spend the night. The rustic rooms make up for their lack of luxury with premier access to one of
                    Goa's best beaches, dedicated lounge chairs right on the sand, and a one-of-a-kind experience that
                    make for a lifetime's worth of memories.

                    1. <u>Bread</u> is an important part of Goan life. Marriage gifts are meaningless without the sweet
                    bread known as the bol. The elders were given loaves and the children were given bread-bangles,
                    which they longed for. Also, the fact that bakery is a profitable profession shows that the love for
                    bread is enormous in God.The bakers use a dress named 'Kabai' which is a single-piece long frock
                    reaching out to the knees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Known as vison or visvan, <u>kingfish</u> is a delicacy in Goa. A popular preparation is kingfish
                    rawa fry: fillets are lightly coated in semolina and fried to form a crispy exterior and succulent
                    interior. It’s also used in surmai (kingfish) curry, which contains grated coconut.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. <u>Kokum</u>, a plant in the mangosteen family is found in the coastal areas of western India.
                    Its ruby-coloured fruits are juiced as well as dried, and used to sour fish and prawn curries in
                    Goan cuisine. Rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, kokum juice is a refreshing drink to beat the
                    heat. Kokum solkadhi, also known as kokum kadhi, is a spicy-tangy-sweet beverage made with coconut
                    milk, spices and liquid extracted from kokum peel. Good for digestion, it’s served at the end of
                    meals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Also called ukda rice, <u>red rice</u> is popular in gourmet circles in India. An unpolished
                    thick-grained rice with a reddish-brown colour and nutty flavour, its firm texture makes it
                    excellent for soaking up coconut curries.

                    1. Goan Hindus are very fond of Natak, Bhajan and Kirtan. Many famous Indian Classical singers hail
                    from Goa, such as, Kishori Amonkar, Kesarbai Kerkar, Jitendra etc..
                    Some traditional Goan dance forms are <u>dekhnni</u>, <u>fugdi</u>, <u>corridinho</u> and
                    <u>dashavatara</u>. Western social
                    dancing is a part of most celebrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The costume of Goans is according to the tropical climate, generally, they wear cotton clothes.
                    Goan Catholic women wear dresses/gowns, while Hindu women wear sari called Nav-vari. Other
                    traditional costumes of Goa people are <u>Pano Bhaju</u>, <u>Valkal</u> is a string of beads and
                    leafy loincloths
                    which is still worn in tribes. Kashti is a tied knot and saree. Goans catholic brides wear a white
                    gown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Coconut climbers/pluckers <u>‘padekars’</u> carry out the harvesting of tender and ripe coconuts
                    from a
                    plantation or residential areas.
                    Traditionally, padekars were paid half in cash, half in coconuts. Nowadays, they charge a reasonable
                    wage per tree (depending on the number of trees). It’s a dying skill and very few padekars are to
                    found. Most of them are the older set, you can rarely find a young one!
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. The crafts and arts of Goa also reflect Hindu, Muslim and Christian origins. Handicrafts are
                    mainly made of materials easily available here like- <u>clay</u>, <u>seashells</u>, paper, bamboo,
                    <u>brass</u>, <u>wood</u>, <u>jute</u>, <u>stone</u> and <u>coconut shells</u> amongst others. With
                    the heavy inflow of tourists the handicrafts industry has also witnessed a boom.

                    Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Even after 400 years, the remains are in good condition and are taken
                    out once every decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The <u>Fort Tiracol</u> was constructed on the orders of Maharaja Khem Sawant Bhonsle, who was
                    the king of Sawantwadi during the advent of the seventeenth century. The hilltop location of the
                    fort gives some of the most exhilarating views of the Arabian sea from its ranks. Due to its
                    location, the fort gained immense importance for maritime defences.
                </p>

                    1. Goa encompasses an area of 3,702 km² (1,430 sq mile). It lies between the latitudes 14°53'54" N
                    and 15°40'00" N and longitudes 73°40'33" E and 74°20'13" E. Most of Goa forms a part of the coastal
                    country known as the <u>Konkan</u>, an escarpment rising up to the <u>Western Ghats</u> range of
                    mountains, which separate it from the <u>Deccan Plateau</u>. The Sonsogor constitutes the highest
                    point, with an altitude of 1,167 metres (3,827 feet). Goa has a coastline of 101 km (63 miles).

                    <u>Mandovi</u>, the <u>Zuari</u>, the <u>Terekhol</u>, <u>Chapora</u> River and the <u>Betul</u>
                    number among Goa's main rivers. The Mormugao harbor on the mouth of the river Zuari serves as one of
                    the best natural harbors in South Asia. The Zuari and the Mandovi act as the lifelines of Goa, with
                    their tributaries draining 69% of its geographic area.

                    Laterites, rich in ferric aluminium oxides and reddish in color, make up most of Goa's soil cover.
                    Further inland and along the river banks, alluvial and loamy soil exist. The soil, rich in minerals
                    and humus, serves farming well. Some of the oldest rocks in the Indian subcontinent lay in Goa
                    between Molem and Anmod on Goa's border with Karnataka.

                    2. <u>Forest cover</u> in Goa stands at 1,424 km², mostly owned by the government. Government owned
                    forest comprises an estimated 1224.38 km² while private accounts for 200 km². The interior eastern
                    regions of the state serve as home for most of the forests in the state. The Western Ghats, which
                    form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognized as one of the world's biodiversity
                    hotspots.
