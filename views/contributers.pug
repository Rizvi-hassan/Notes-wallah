        p Arnav Dutta is my classmate and one of my best friends. When I discussed about the project with him, he got super excited and asked me can he also contribute and I said why not. He has been provided various notes to me. And also he is the first contributer of my website.

        p Kaushik is not my classmate but a friend as we play cricket together. At first I had no Idea about notes of class 10. When he heard about this site, he said me that he will give the notes of 10th class. I am very happy that he is helping me in building this site and I am thankful to him for this.
