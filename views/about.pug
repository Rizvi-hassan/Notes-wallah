        p This is a web app where you can find all the notes and solutions of NCERT class 11 and 12. This web app is created only for educational purposes.
        p It uses a node js environment which runs in the background to serve various pages. I have used Express js and pug to prepare the template of the site and served through a free hosting site named

        p My name is Md. Rizvi Hassan Ansari. I am a student of 11th. I am a program geek and I love coding.
        p Recently, I learnt backend in web developement and its so exciting that I could not resist myself from applying it in a fully fledged website.
        p I thought that there are many studensts who cannot write all the notes provided by the teachers and ask to toppers for the notes when the exams are at doorstep.
        p So, I though why not to create a web app which would solve their problem.
        p I have been programing in different languages since I was in 6th std. If you are interested you can visit my
